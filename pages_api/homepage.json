This is a place for me to test out what I've learned and show off my new skills in HTML and CSS.\n<br><br>\nI've been living in Edinburgh for two years, and love the city. I'm originally from Northumberland, just south of the border. I'm really enjoying coding so far - as well as HTML and CSS I've started on some simple Ruby.
